# Rotate Selection

In order to rotate selection you can use either [selection handles](rotate.md#handles) or [menu options](rotate.md#menu-options), both ways will rotate the selection around the [rotation pivot](rotate.md#rotation-pivot) using the selected [rotation algorithm](rotate.md#rotation-algorithms).

## Rotation Pivot

<!-- TODO: PNG, context bar with Rotation Pivot highlighted -->

Selection is rotated around a single, defined point. By default pivot point is set in the center of the selection and is not visible until you start rotating the image. Its placement and visibility settings can be changed from a menu, accessible via a button from the context bar of any selection tool.

<!-- TODO: GIF, selected sprite, showcase setting "Display pivot point by default" -->

Rotation pivot can also be moved with a mouse by left-clicking and dragging the point.

## Handles

Selection can be rotated by moving your mouse to the outer part of a handle, left-clicking and dragging your mouse around the canvas. A cursor change will indicate dragging a handle will resize or rotate the selection.
